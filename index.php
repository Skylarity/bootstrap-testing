					Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are

					evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24
					hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in
					a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.

					When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The game's not big enough unless it scares you
					a little. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. This is not about revenge. This is
					about justice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Now we know what they mean
					by 'advanced' tactical training. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Damage report! Fear is the
					true enemy, the only enemy. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input
					patterns. Well, that's certainly good to know. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't
					give orders around here. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. About four
					years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Talk about going nowhere fast. and attack the
					Romulans. This should be interesting. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of
					those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sorry, Data. Maybe we better talk out
					here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I
					wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. And blowing into maximum warp speed,
					you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I can't. As much as I care about you, my
					first duty is to the ship. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Worf, It's better
					than music. It's jazz.
